# Cox_forecast_ensemble

Code to fit forecast models for salmon, including dynamic linear models and model averaged ensembles

## Table of contents

-   Test_notebook.rmd - This is an R markdown file that calls functions to fit the models and render the output tables and plots.

    -   The first part where data is loaded is a mess, because I have commented out various data-loading code. Sorry about that.

-   functions.r - This file contains most of the functions to do the analysis.

-   dlm_resid_fixed.r - This file calculates model residuals.
